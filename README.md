# Purpose

Implementing the sieve of Eratosthenes in x64 assembly for fun ^^ (MaelHos encouraged me to do it some years ago, and I feel like now I am ready).

# Usage

In src I have a file `build.sh` which builds the project (compiling with `gcc` because I want format strings to print).
Then I wrote a script in python to pretty print the results.
